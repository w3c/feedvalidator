<h2>Message</h2>
<div class="docbody">
<p>Identifier “foo” is not in canonical form (the canonical form would be “bar”)</p>
</div>
<h2>Explanation</h2>

<div class="docbody">
<p>URIs used as identifiers should be in canonical form, as described
by section 6 of
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC 3986</a>.
This means that insignificant differences
(e.g., case of hostname) are removed, so URIs can be compared
character-by-character to determine equivalence. This is particularly
important when content is syndicated, and the same entry may appear
in multiple feeds.</p>
<p>Also avoid leading and trailing whitespace as clients
vary in their interpretation of such characters.</p>
</div>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<div class="docbody">
<p>All newly issued ids should be in canonical form.
Use the canonical form given in the warning message for guidance.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do <b>not</b> update previously issued ids, unless they were issued
in error.</li>
<li>Do <b>not</b> canonicalize ids that you are resyndicating from
other sources.  Those <b>must</b> be character by character identical
to the original.  Instead, consider contacting the original source and
see if this can be corrected for any new ids they may issue.</li>
</ul>
